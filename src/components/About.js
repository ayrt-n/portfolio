      <p className="mb-3">Hi! My name is Ayrton Parkinson. I am a highly motivated and passionate self-taught full stack web developer from Ontario, Canada.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">While originally going to school for economics and finance, I'd started coding as a hobby through 2021 and from that point on, I was hooked. Since then, I have focused most of my free time learning and building, largely through The Odin Project; an online, free, open source full stack web development coding curriculum.</p>
      <p className="mb-3">I am currently looking to apply the skills I have learned and collaborate on meaningful and challenging problems while continuing to develop my understanding of the intricacies of computer science, and clean, scalable, performant code.</p>
